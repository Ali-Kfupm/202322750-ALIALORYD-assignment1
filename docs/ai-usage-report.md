# AI Usage Report

## 1. Tools Used & Use Cases

### Tool Used:
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5.2)**

### How I Used It:

I used ChatGPT as a development assistant during this portfolio assignment. Specifically, I used it for:

- Improving code structure and readability
- Adding meaningful comments to my CSS and JavaScript files
- Debugging layout and responsive design issues
- Refining the responsive behavior for desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- Improving UI/UX consistency and spacing
- Assisting with documentation writing (README and this report)

ChatGPT helped me understand best practices rather than simply copying code. I reviewed, tested, and modified all suggestions before integrating them into my project.
